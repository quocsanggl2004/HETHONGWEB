        <p><span style="color:red;">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful
            performances. I've started putting up a <a href="slide1.html">slide show</a> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me. Once again:
            <span style="color: red;"> BRAVO!!!</span> -- Mrs. Juroszek</p>
